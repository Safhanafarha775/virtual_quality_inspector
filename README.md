# Virtual Quality Inspector 🏭🔍

## Project Overview
A Computer Vision based automated quality inspection system that detects
defects, color inconsistencies, blur, and dimension variations in products
using OpenCV and Python.

This project simulates a real-world manufacturing quality control system.

## Features
- 📏 Dimension verification
- 🎨 Color consistency checking
- ⚡ Blur & sharpness detection
- 🧩 Defect detection using edges & contours
- ✅ Pass / Fail quality decision
- 📊 Visual inspection report

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## How It Works
1. Upload product images
2. System analyzes:
   - Size
   - Color
   - Edges
   - Blur
3. Generates visual report
4. Gives PASS / FAIL result

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Upload images when prompted
3. Run all cells
4. View inspection results

## Sample Use Cases
- Manufacturing quality inspection
- Defect detection
- Visual inspection automation
- Computer vision learning project

## Future Improvements
- Deep Learning defect detection
- Real-world measurement calibration
- Batch inspection
- Web dashboard
